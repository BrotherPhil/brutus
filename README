This is a fork of Caesure bitcoin client, renamed to Brutus
I had to add a few fixes to work with testnet-in-a-box on win32 machine.

You may try to replace ecdsa_ssl with ecdsa_pure + python-ecdsa package,
but check all outputs carefully, looks like there is a bug.

How to use:

download testnet-in-a-box:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/testnet-in-a-box

run first node:
bitcoin -server -datadir=1

run second node:
python bitcoin.py -w wallet.testnet.bin -t -c 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1

make a new key using
http://localhost:8380/admin/wallet/

check block downloading

enable built-in block generation (or use external rpc miner):
bitcoin -datadir=1 setgenerate true

make some transactions, debug, fix, repeat
